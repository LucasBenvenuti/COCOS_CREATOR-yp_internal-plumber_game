# One game to be used in 3D Platform project

The 3D Platform - https://github.com/LucasBenvenuti/COCOS_CREATOR-yp_internal-platform - is filled with lots of games. Besides other games that I was mentoring and pair programming, this one was made by me.
It's a game that you need to create a path throught the pipes for the seeds reach the end.

The code of this game was made thinking about reusing it into the many types of pipes the game has.
It's a common behavior between them, so it could be done easily.
